The other day the story happened, which I can not digest. A neighbor with whom we are two years limited by hand by hand * and rare conversations about the weather, called the door.

Well, in fact, to offer assistance to a neighbor - it's normal, right and praiseworthy. This good-neighborly relations. Belarusians, of course, serious people, but it is necessary to squeeze out a smile and appoint its duty. Over time it will become a natural and involuntary. And offer assistance to the neighbors - sincerely, without ulterior motives - will also be a natural impulse.

No not like this. Political issue was the limit of 130 km / h
With so many advantages, it is a wonder that we are allowed to drive at 130 km / h at all. "Its introduction was controversial at the time", says Van Wee, who worked on a study into the effects of this kind of speed increase in 2011. "There was no parliamentary majority for it, but the VVD (Liberal Party) included it in its manifesto, so they managed to get it through in the negotiations to form a coalition.

and a reduction of up to 100 km / h is technically possible to avoid a fine from the EU and Activities Project, where such emissions can not be avoided or can not be reduced - the same building.

If cars, vans and motorcycles start driving at 100 km / h instead of 120 or 130, this will reduce deposition by a few tenths of one percent. Although nature will not notice the difference, the reduction will make it possible for several construction projects to go ahead.

And this
Driving at 100 km / h is also much safer. At speeds above 100 km / h, every kilometre faster results in 3 to 4 percent more fatalities. Part of this is pure physics: the energy Of a Collision IS Equal to Half The Mass of the Object Times The Square of Its Velocity (1/2mv2). "The Impact Is Theraefore Much Greater, And The Likelihood Of Accidents Is Also Increased. Lorries Drive at 80 to 90 KM / H and Passenger Vehicles Between 100 and 130; The Discrepancy Between These Speeds Causes More Accidents ... This Advantage IS at Its Greatest If We Drive At 90 KM / H, But 100 Is Already Much Better Than 120 O 130. LESS CONGESTION ALSO Means That Travel Times Become More Reliable.
But it is more important to decide what was more important to provide a percentage of a percentage of NOX emissions percent or improving security.

In general, the NL is very strong the rule "Want to have been done - do it yourself," from the little things, like the cleaning of the sidewalk in front of your own home (you can wait and workers will come from the municipality, but you will live with an untidy sidewalk) to political life.
Two or three years ago, elections were held in "Water Tips", while anyone living in NL took part in them, not even citizens, simply because these tips will form the budgets of drainage, water treatment and collected taxes, and Taxes pay all.
Protests against coronary consumers pass throughout the winter, while everything began with minorities on the type of flat ceilchors and other supporters of different conspiracies, but after these comrades several times very strongly looked from the police for violation of sociality and other security measures (it was even in The news of the Russian Federation) The usual middle class came out on their defense and the rally was already against the arbitrariness of the police.

Intersiti gets up from each chich (heavy rain, strong wind, half a hundred snow - trains got up), any repair of roads lasts for years (Rokin near Rembrandtplein has been repaired for more than a year, the site is not very big.

2. It would be interesting to learn the details about the house in which you live. What is hiding behind a number of 400 thousand in the town of HoofdDorp? Is it typical for close Europe ROW HOUSE, a hybrid in the form of semi-detached or a full-fledged house? What section, what area of ​​the house?

1. 70.000 per year Gross == 3.832 per month. Added to the article a picture, and thetax.nl truth gives the opportunity to calculate everything that is interesting.
2. House in the row, the most common type of housing here. I added an paragraph about the density of building in the article, specifically my house - 115 square meters. m. of the inner area (it seems here only the area includes the ceiling height more than one and a half meters), and 120 area area. The house itself is not quite ordinary - it goes to the canal, there are no neighbors "Window in the window" in the backyard, located in a not better area. The same house could well be 100,000 more expensive, being in a more expensive area - and vice versa, the average price of the house in the area 50,000 below.

In general, Holland is very dense, and it can be hard to live a fence in the fence, a window in the window. The only alternative - rural areas away from Randstad, in principle, with the development of the removal, it can be a good option ... But you will have to cut 10-20 kilometers to the café (well, as in the USA: D)

Personally, I am a closed and shy man, but I do not test inconvenience from density. In Amsterdam, I feel, even looking at the queue for a children's slide, it becomes unable to live in itself - so I could not live. And when there is a distance of a couple of meters - already normal.

The initial contribution is not required that there is a low interest rate, leads to the great popularity of mortgages, which makes a significant contribution to the lack of supply in the housing market, which leads to overbidding (the trade itself for the increase).

What about children?
Gardics are paid and very expensive if you walk for a full day. Outside Amsterdam, expathers issue a certificate that the family does not speak Dutch and in the kindergarten can be held for 11 hours a week for 5 euros per month. In Amsterdam and the surrounding area there is no such thing, too much poning. If you drive a full day, five days a week, it easily flies 1500-1600 euros per month. If both parents work or learn, the state will reimburse the costs of kindergarten, but compensation depends on the cumulative family income. The less income - the more will be returned.
(This year the government resigned on this occasion, read, if interesting)
If only one works, you will not be returned.
Local is common to take papades (father's day) and Mamadah (Mother's Day), that is, only 4 days a week to work, and one day to sit with children. Thus, the kindergarten is needed only three days a week, and this is something about 600-800 euros per month, that with compensation will be about 200-400 in the end.
But what kind of kindergarten was not a financial pome, children go to school from 4 years. At it exactly the day after the birthday. According to the law, it is mandatory from five, but a year at my own account no one takes, and why, if the school is the same kindergarten, only free. PRA There are sometimes up to 30 people in comparison with a kindergarten, where the limit of 8-10 children.
Education to the level of the university is free and compulsory. Even if the family is illegal, you can go to school and the child will take it, as it is his right to learn. Integration schools for children are also free. There are international schools, this is when taught in English, and not in Dutch, these paid, from 400 euros per month (depends on age, city and a lot more), more real - 600.
The unit will be from 2k per year, the average price is 4-5k.

Of the additional expenses - are great, since the children of the growth quickly and great need to be changed every couple of years, and swimming courses. Without a large and swimming diploma, may not take on some GG Tours.

You need not so much the question to ask, since these numbers will not say much, but overpayment.
For example, the mortgage of 350 thousand, for 25 years, overpayment (interest and loan service) will be about 80-100 thousand (the percentage will be about 2%) - the final value of the house will be ~ 450 thousand euros.
In the Russian Federation, the mortgage of 3 million under 10% for the same 25 years will sometimes give 5 million overnames and the final cost of up to 8 million rubles.

In general, it converges with my experience in Amsterdam and Hoorn 2 years.

Regarding the isolation - a group of board games was saved (there is a man 200-250, and not only expata) - I am so far Ors consistent and when I go again to visit Amsterdam - to take off the people of fame :) It will help, by the way, both with the language and with sociability. But, however, there is mainly everything in Amsterdam. But HoofdDorp is not far away, there I look at the bike easy to get there :) This Didscord server group and on / R / AMSterdam are periodically the people of invites will post. Can you send me a PM, give the link if necessary.

And so, anyone who in the Netherlands is going to go, buy or take a bike in Swapfiets and get used to the car, in most cases, do not need well. For trips outside the city - trains. And in Amsterdam itself faster on the bike almost everywhere. I lived at the 53rd metro branch at Kraaaiennest station, worked by Westerpark (15 minutes walk from the central station to the office). Metro + on foot took 40-45 minutes, the bicycle after a month drive was obtained 30-35 minutes (depending on the wind on that day: d.

With salaries Yes, the Aytichnik does not live rich in the Netherlands - there are large salaries for local standards only in international companies and it is not always - thanks to the progressive income tax, which grows up to 42% - that income from raising salaries significantly added money on their hands According to my calculations you need to earn more than 70k per year, then the tax is no longer growing. But what would get a tangible increase, adding 10K salaries per year we will not change the situation.

Well, the rental market, it is generally a separate song. I am on my 60K per year to allow myself an apartment to shoot in Amsterdam (well, how, in the theory I could shoot a studio, but to give 50% + from salary for rent - an idiotic idea, so I took a room, and then went to live in Hoorn - there Removed a whole row house for 1000 euros per month).

Regarding the car - never regretted that they bought, although expensive.

Well swapflets you can just take in any city (I took in Amsterdam) where they are, just if something breaks - they will not come to repair where they do not have a coating (i.e. they have to drag before the service item) . And so the service is chic, I think. For the visits of expatov, it is generally ideal for the first time, while it will not be created (but, considering how the bikes steal in Amsterdam, IMHO, it is better to simply swapfiets and use - they do not need anyone and everyone knows them, so no one to buy with hands) . It is so more info for the rest. You already know everything already.

With the north it is interesting in terms of trains. In general, Hoorn chose simply by the fact that there was a suitable house and, in general, I liked the city. And then one curious detail surfaced - InterCity on Enkhuizen does not stop at all between Amsterdam Sloterdijk and Hoorn, walk every 30 minutes. Amsterdam Centraal Ride time - Hoorn - 31 minutes. As far as I know, in the direction of the North, this is the only such fast train - colleagues in Alkmaar ride, with a bunch of stops. And, this train is very free - how much I did not go, even at the rush hour there was always where to sit down. And on Alkmaar complained that he was forever scored a bit.

Regarding the car - yes, here already have anyone like. I am pretty quickly used to any weather (except Storm Wind) ride a bike. Just to freeze clothes and suitable bikes. But I and one was, so I was easier. I first could not understand how people with large nets from supermarkets drives.

And if we talk about a particular person and his chances to get sharpening, then they have all different. I do not know how in other countries, and in the Russian Federation the overwhelming majority of murders are domestic, "on the soil suddenly arising acute dislike."

That was what I mean, when I wrote that it was possible to look at some other parameter to assess the "security" of the area. How do you, for example, the number of thefts with the penetration of the population?

Excellent written! Very structured and alive.
Integration for introverts, really urgent problem. I heard that some helps:
1. Volunteering (Aka Vrijwilligerswerk). Locals in this regard are very individualized, and use themselves as themselves. For example, every Saturday wishes to come and plant something in a local park or garden, and after the seagull go to drink and what is hard. Often about projects can be found from the neighbors.
2. It is possible to expand the circle of communication at the expense of the Russian community, for example, through Saturday Russian schools. There are reimbursed from 4 years (in Amsterdam there are several pieces of them).

1 - Many different sports clubs - in HOOFdorpe there is a basketball club and a league for mature lovers. Tennis clubs with personal coaches or group classes - Hoofdorp is in Arnoldus Park
2 - surprisingly in flat as the board of Holland very popular skiing - very many go to the Alps in winter. You can apply for training at any time of the year on skis or snowboard - the artificial route is in the same Arnoldus Park - it is not suitable for fun riding, but for learning it is quite
3 - All that is connected by the sea by waves and wind - 30 minutes from HoofdDorp there is a seaside town of Zaandvort - there if cheaper you can take surfing lessons, more expensive - kaitsurfing
In addition, you can remove the sailing boat with friends and ride - but it's nicer to do it not at sea and on lakes like Markermeer or Ijsselmeer - plus you need an experienced skipper in this business.
If the weather is hot, you can simply buy yourself a sup-board and ride a lake in Tolenburg or Harlemmermeerse BOS. Very cool talk to ride SUP in Haarlem - you can see the old city from the water. In Hoofdorp itself on the lake I saw the guys who are engaged in diving
4 - My passion is aircraft - you can sign up for Pilot Courses - But the exercise is quite expensive
5 - Even run or ride on a highway in the summer very cool occupation. Many bikes runs through dunes - beautiful places.

Welkome Bij HoofdDorp! A very sensible description, it is still worth saying about a fairly large community of Russian-speaking in the Netherlands (and especially in Haarlemmermeer and the surrounding area): on the one hand, it satisfies the need for communication, but at the same time leads to isolation from the local society. Only TG-groups from gardening to cars are more than a dozen.

Service - Relocateme.eu.
I no longer remember the details, but I called me, told about two options, of which I didn't like it immediately immediately, organized a test task. On a separate conscript, a couple of general councils were given as to be interviewed (to show interest, ask questions) and what not to do (ask just a salary).
Then there should have been two remote interviews and a trip to the office for an acquaintance with the team - but we had a vacation in Amster. Therefore, I immediately went for a full-time technical interview (presentation of my test). after Returning home was two more remote mess and offer.

Going so -lo on the street, throw a chance to the side and you see a carefree Dutchman sitting in her living room on a sofa with a glass of beer and looking tv. Just like he visited him.

TUJH 19.05.2021 at 00:05

Depends on the region and needs / requests. If Philips is lucky to Eindhoven, it is much cheaper than in ampts, but also salaries below. The main cost of expenses in any case will be housing. For Eindhoven 1100 - apartments for 2-3 bedrooms or 1300-1400 per typical townhouse. This is the norm, and for Amsterdam for 1500 the norm will be a studio of 30 meters.
I advise you to climb on www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/eindhoven with your calculations.

Well, count - with RULING (but this is only the first 5 years) it turns out 3443 per month clean, of which 1300 per housing. If you eat one - well, yes, it will be enough for food and on other expenses and to postpone on a little.

TUJH 19.05.2021 at 09:50

It depends on, as they say, if one or with his wife, then the norms. If there is a child, I would say that there is little. The type of contract also strongly affects if it is a direct contract with Philips, then the norms, if through the PAYROLL layer (frequent phenomenon for visiting on the first work), then they will still take 200-300 euros every month for the services.
Again where to live if in the apartment in Strijp-S then the rent will eat 800 per month, but if in Witte Dame it will easily reach 2000 per month and more.
The average level of salaries of developers in Eind 55-60K per year.

The concept of "comfortable" is very subjective ... to someone comfortably live with three students on the outskirts and prepare yourself a vegetarian food every day, and someone wants a house in the center and eat at home only on holidays (ordering Catering). The difference will be five times.

No one will decide for you - see the budget in the article, there is little that will be different in lifetime. The medstrashka is 2 times smaller, cosmetics are smaller and can slightly less groceries. But one I would cook less, for example, so Outings would be the same if no more.

Thanks for the article, everything is very detailed and how I lived 2 years I can confirm most of the written.
I have a question about the Dutch language, as I understood from the article, for 4 years, you did not succeed with my spouse, but what are the plans in the future? Seriously learn or leave everything as is? I ask because it is the question of integration and the issue of obtaining citizenship of naturalization, although heard real cases when the language is taught only for the naturalization exam and then they are safely scored and speak English. Plus, the moment, children who go to the local school and kindergarten usually teach Dutch (much faster than the parents of expatov).

1. It was not possible to master, now I work in a more Dutch office, organizing courses - so I learge seriously. Female is more difficult.
2. Exams for naturalization We have long passed for a long time, but the level of the level for them is needed at all spoken.
3. With the child we have the main concern that he spoke in Russian. The Dutch for him will be relatives. And the Dutch we will most likely come to a conversational when he goes to school.
4. To live without Dutch, you need a few conditions - to live in Randstad, calmly treat the phrases "ooo, you live here for so long here and still do not know the language," you calmly react to the fact that something says to you and goes, to periodically use GoogleTranslete, have a plan of action in case "I have something to , but he does not speak English.

Friends from Harlem who gone to the Dutch with the Harlemian accent could not "find a common language" with waiters in Brabant and simply switched to English.

Many thanks for the detailed answer. Please tell me even by the terms of your mortgage, as far as I understood, no one hinders it early, but it will not be revealed for the whole amount, if we take into account the usual average income level. Is it possible to somehow refuse it under the terms of the contract in the case of departure or moving to another country? And if so, what are the penalties in this case?
 0.
To answer

DRFDOOCH 19.05.2021 at 11:10

- The conditions for early repayment are different, we can no finish pay off 10% of the initial amount per year.
- In the case of the sale of the house, the mortgage is quenched without a fine, the money remaining after the repayment returns to you. If the amount of sale is less than the remaining mortgage body - I do not know exactly how, but you have to return the money.
- In the case of moving abroad, it is quite realistic to obtain permission to rent a house for rent, most likely the rents will be enough for repayment of the mortgage.
